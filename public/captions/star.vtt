I've imagined you play a very
irritating game of chess.

1
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.999
And I'm traveling faster than
is possible when normal space

2
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.399
to any planet 

3
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.699
and Hira 

4
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.899
we can go back in time. 

5
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.699
They may risk it Sunday night
is fine.

6
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.999
I'm sorry, 

7
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.099
please 

8
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.399
in this galaxy 

9
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.999
is a mathematical probability 

10
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.799
of 3 million earth-type planets 

11
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.599
and all the others 

12
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.599
doing the 

13
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.999
million galaxies like this 

14
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.199
and in all of that 

15
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.899
and perhaps more 

16
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.199
I want. 

17
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.099
Each of us 

18
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.099
don't destroy them on me.
