without change 

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.099
without passion 

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.799
and without logic 

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.299
it lives to kill 

6
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.499
a Mindless eating machine. 

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.199
It will attack 

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.799
and devour 

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.899
anything 

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.499
it is as if God.  Created the
devil

11
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.299
and gave him 

12
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.899
Jaws

13
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.899

14
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.299

15
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.799
extraordinary Motion Picture
version

16
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.799
of Peter. 

17
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.699
Benchley's best-selling novel

Jaws. 

19
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.599

21
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.399
About killed here last week. 

22
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.799
You knew it. 

23
00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.199
You knew that was a shark out
there.

24
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.099
You knew it was dangerous 

25
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.499
swimming anyway. 

26
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.999
It's all psychological 

27
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.799
you yell Barracuda 

28
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.299
devices. 

29
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.899
Why'd 

30
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.299
you yell shark? 

31
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.099
We've got a panic on our hands
on the fourth of July.

32
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.288
Is it true that most people get
attacked by sharks in three

33
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.199
feet of water about 10 feet
from the beach.

34
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.499
Yeah, 

35
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.499
what we are dealing with here
is a perfect engine

36
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.788
an eating machine turned out on
to go to have to close the

37
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.099
beach.

38
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.389
We're gonna have to hire
somebody to kill the shark and

39
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.899
fish

40
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.299
but I'll catch him and kill him. 

41
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.099

42
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.299

44
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.698

46
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.699
